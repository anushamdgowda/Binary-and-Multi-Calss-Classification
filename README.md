# Binary-and-Multi-Calss-Classification
 Task 1: Social Media Fake News Detection Classify social media posts/comments (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) as original or fake.  ðŸ”¹ Task 2: FakeDetect-Malayalam Identify and categorize fake news articles in Malayalam into five classes: False, Half True, Mostly False, Partly False, Mostly True.
Project Overview
The project aims to classify Malayalam news articles as either real or fake. It combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and deep learning models to achieve this goal. The main steps involved are:

Data Loading: Loading the training, development, and test datasets.
Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant characters.
Feature Engineering: Converting text into numerical representations using FastText embeddings.
Model Training: Training deep learning models, including Bi-RNN, DNN, GRU, and LSTM + RNN, for classification.
Ensemble Learning: Combining the predictions of multiple models to improve overall accuracy.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK
TextBlob
Model Details
Bi-RNN: Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network.
DNN: Deep Neural Network.
GRU: Gated Recurrent Unit.
LSTM + RNN: Long Short-Term Memory combined with a Recurrent Neural Network.
Fusion Model: An ensemble of the above models.
Results
The models were evaluated on a development set and achieved promising results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The fusion model, in particular, showed significant improvement over individual models.

Future Work
Explore other embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec and GloVe.
Experiment with different deep learning architectures, such as CNN and Transformer models.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Evaluate the models on a larger and more diverse dataset.
Develop a web application to make the fake news detection system accessible to users.
